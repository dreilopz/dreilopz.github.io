# MeatOut Day, Thursday March 20. Eat Vegetarian!

This thursday march 20 is [MeatOut Day](http://www.meatout.org "MeatOut
Website"), an international effort to raise awareness of the problems of
factory farming and the benefits of a plant-based diet. From the [MeatOut
website](http://www.meatout.org "MeatOut Website"):

> Meatout is an international observance helping individuals evolve to a
> wholesome, compassionate diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains. The
> purpose is to expose the public to the joys and benefits of a plant-based
> diet, while promoting the availability and selection alternatives to meat and
> dairy in mainstream grocery stores, restaurants, and catering operations.

Plan your thursday and contribute to this international project of raising
awareness and massive action by consuming vegetarian dishes. Each individual
participation has considerable effect and thus is valuable.

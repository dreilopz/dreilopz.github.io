One of the most inspirational scientists to ever live, Carl Sagan would have
been 80 years old today. Sagan & Druyan on animals, exploitation and suffering.

> "Philosophers of marauding high-technology civilizations have often argued
> that humans deserve a category distinct from and above all the other animals.
> It is not enough that humans have a different assortment of the qualities
> evident in the other animals – more of some traits, fewer of others. A
> radical difference in kind, not some fuzzy-edged difference in degree, is
> needed, longed for, sought.
> 
> Almost all of them believed that our distinction arises from something made
> neither of matter nor of energy that resides within the bodies of humans, but
> of no one else on Earth. **No scientific evidence for such a 'something' has
> ever been produced**. Only a few of the great Western philosophers – David
> Hume, for instance – argued, as Darwin did, that **the differences between
> our species and others were only of degree**.
> 
> ... What can we learn about ourselves from an apparent error so widespread,
> propagated by so many leading philosophers and scientists, both ancient and
> modern, and with such assurance and self-satisfaction?
> 
> One of several possible answers: A sharp distinction between humans and
> 'animals' is essential if we are to bend them to our will, make them work for
> us, wear them, eat them – without any disquieting tinges of guilt or regret.
> With untroubled consciences, we can render whole species extinct, for our
> perceived short-term benefit, or even through simple carelessness. Their loss
> is of little import: Those beings, we tell ourselves, are not like us. An
> unbridgeable gap has thus a practical role to play beyond the mere stroking
> of human egos. Darwin's formulation of this answer was: <cite>Animals whom we
> have made our slaves, we do not like to consider our equals.</cite>"
> 
> ... Humans – who enslave, castrate, experiment on, and fillet other animals –
> have had an understandable penchant for pretending that animals do not feel
> pain. On whether we should grant some modicum of rights to other animals, the
> philosopher Jeremy Bentham stressed that **the question was not how smart
> they are, but how much torment they can feel**...
> 
> From all criteria available to us – the recognizable agony in the cries of
> wounded animals, for example, including those who usually utter hardly a
> sound – this question seems moot. The limbic system in the human brain, known
> to be responsible for much of the richness of our emotional life, is
> prominent throughout the mammals. The same drugs that alleviate suffering in
> humans mitigate the cries and other signs of pain in many other animals. It
> is unseemly of us, who often behave so unfeelingly toward other animals, to
> contend that only humans can suffer."
